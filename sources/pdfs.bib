abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {In this paper, it is proposed to build a new framework which anticipates mobile user status and behavior characteristics with the aim of increasing user engagement and provide stickiness in mobile applications (iOS-Android) by using machine learning techniques. Motivation of this study is based on the idea of collecting data from users by non-survey methods because data collection from surveys may mislead the system model according to the literature researches on user experience. User behavior includes forecasting next usage time of the user, user motivation type, user mastery level and current context of the user. In order to find relevant patterns, usage data is obtained from pilot mobile applications at first and then they are processed according to the chosen machine learning algorithm. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Jarrett and Gaffney come to the rescue with Designing Forms that Work, clearly explaining exactly how to design great forms for the web.

That's because as the fidelity of the project we're working on increases, the effort involved in making changes increases. If we can test out early ideas to see if they work, in small chunks, then we can identify whether those ideas are going to work. To do this, we need to build prototypes. With easy-to-follow, practical advice, this book will show you how to use a number of different prototyping techniques to improve UX. It covers: The prototyping process Paper prototyping Interactive wireframing tools, such as Balsamiq and Axure Dedicated prototyping tools, including Marvel, Invision, and Adobe XD HTML prototypes How to use prototypes in your project workflow},
